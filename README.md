This repository holds Shannon Chang's lab09 files for Stat 159, taken fall 2016 at UC Berkeley. 
The `report.Rnw` (and its accompanying .pdf version) details the simple linear regression analysis 
of the relationship between product sales and television advertising budgets. This analysis is a 
reproduction of the one discussed in Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert 
Tibshirani's [_An Introduction to Statistical Learning_](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf). 
Results are based on the [`Advertising.csv`](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv) 
dataset.
